# APIRestJPATOMEE9

This project implements a JAVARS API Rest using JPA and dependency injection in TOMEE 9. In this GITHUB account there is a version of this API REST utilizing jdbc
as database connection. AS a reminder, this API is intended to work in conjuntion with an android APP. The target database is a XAMPP mariaDB. In the event of using MYSQl instead
you should remember to change the mysqlconector version to 8.0.11. In addition, it is mandatory to add a data-source resource to the TOMEE server as specified in the 
file persistence.xml.
